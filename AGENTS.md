# Dice Chess Reference Bot — AI Agent Guidelines

## Architecture Overview
- **Domain**: Reference bot and starter kit for the Dice Chess Bot API (JVM / Scala 3).
- **Core Stack**: Cats Effect 3, FS2, http4s Ember client, Circe, Logback, Munit Cats Effect.
- **Engine**: Wraps `com.fortemate:dicechess-engine` for game rules, legality checking, and search algorithms (greedy, monte-carlo, aggressive, etc.).
- **Strategy**: Extensible `Strategy` interface (`chooseMoves(ctx: MoveContext): Option[List[String]]`).
- **Licensing**: MIT. (Note: linking `com.fortemate:dicechess-engine` subjects the combined distribution to AGPL-3.0 terms).

## Developer Workflows
- **Toolchain**: Managed via `mise` (`mise run setup`, `mise run check`).
- **Core Runner**: Use `sbt` for all development activities.
- **Tests**: `sbt test` (runs Munit Cats Effect test suite).
- **Coverage**: `sbt "clean; coverage; test; coverageReport"` (`mise run coverage`).
- **Code Formatting**: `sbt scalafmtCheckAll scalafmtSbtCheck` / `sbt scalafmtAll scalafmtSbt`.
- **Packaging / Staging**: `sbt stage` via sbt-native-packager.

## Branch & Issue Guidelines
- **Branches**: `<type>/<short-desc>` or `<type>/<id>-<short-desc>` (`feat/`, `fix/`, `bug/`, `task/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `ci/`, `test/`, `perf/`).
- **GitHub Issues**: Use native GitHub Issue Types (`Feature`, `Task`, `Bug`) rather than issue labels.
- **PR Description**: Reference closed issues with `Closes #ID`.
- **Commits & PRs**: English language only.

## Issue management
<!-- dc-shared:issue-management v2 — keep identical across Fortemate repositories -->

- Use the native GitHub Issue Type as the canonical work classification:
  - `Bug` for unexpected or incorrect behavior.
  - `Feature` for a request, idea, or new user-visible capability.
  - `Task` for a specific piece of engineering, research, maintenance, or documentation work.
- Never commit directly to a repository's default branch. Name branches `<type>/<short-description>` or `<type>/<id>-<short-description>` using the canonical types `task|feat|bug|refactor|chore|docs|ci|test|perf`. Include an Issue id only when the pull request is intended to fully complete that Issue; otherwise omit it or use the id of an independently actionable sub-issue. Example: `bug/42-fix-dfen-parser`.
- Do not apply `bug` or `enhancement` labels to Issues merely to repeat their Type. Keep those labels for pull-request release classification. On Issues, labels describe only a technical domain or cross-cutting concern, and only existing repository labels may be used.
- **Never apply or remove the `jules` label.** It is a human-only execution trigger that immediately dispatches an autonomous agent; it is not classification metadata. Humans apply it only to a reviewed `Ready` Issue and remove it when its pull request merges or the Issue is closed or reopened.
- Before creating or updating an Issue, search relevant Fortemate repositories across open and closed Issues for semantic duplicates. Read the live Types, field options, labels, assignees, and relationships before mutation; never rely on cached IDs or invent metadata.
- GitHub-facing work items are English-only. Use the appropriate Issue Form when available, or `gh issue create --body-file <file>` for CLI creation; never pass a multiline body inline. Every Issue must contain `Context`, `Objective`, and a testable `Definition of Done`.
- Add every actionable Issue (never pull requests) to the organization Project [Fortemate Engineering](https://github.com/orgs/fortemate/projects/1).
- Use Project `Status` only for workflow state:
  - `Backlog` means triaged but not committed for active work.
  - `Ready` means sufficiently defined and available to start.
  - `In progress` means someone is actively working on it.
  - `In review` means implementation is waiting for review or validation.
  - `Done` means the Issue is closed or the pull request is merged.
- Set the Project `Execution tier` during triage:
  - `Routine` for a bounded, reversible task suitable for Jules or another low-cost agent.
  - `Mid` for a well-scoped task that needs a stronger coding agent with iterative supervision.
  - `Frontier` for architecture, public contracts, complex diagnosis, or other high-blast-radius work; human-led.
  - `Human-only` for releases, production operations, secrets, or legal decisions that must never be delegated.
  - `Decompose` for work too large to route as-is: split it into sub-issues, tier each, then re-tier or close the parent.
  - A blank value means the Issue has not been routed yet.
- Leave the organization `Priority` Issue field blank for normal work. Set it only to deliberately jump the queue: `Urgent` for an immediate incident, security problem, or release blocker; `High` for important or blocking planned work. Never replace organization fields with labels or duplicate Project fields.
- Triage establishes Type, Execution tier, applicable labels, Project membership, Status, and relationships (plus Priority only for queue-jumpers). Assign an Issue only when a person owns its next action, and assign the active owner before moving it to `In progress`; unassigned means agent pool or no current owner, not low priority.
- Use parent/sub-issue relationships for independently actionable decomposition, `Blocking`/`Blocked by` for hard ordering dependencies, and `Relates to` for non-blocking associations. If the live UI or API cannot create a relation, add an explicit `Related: owner/repository#<id>` cross-reference. Do not simulate relationships with title prefixes, labels, or duplicate task lists.
- When a pull request targets the repository's default branch and fully completes an Issue, link it with `Closes #<id>` or `Closes owner/repository#<id>`. Use a non-closing reference for partial work or for a pull request targeting any other branch.
- After every Issue, pull-request, or Project mutation, read the item back. For an Issue, verify Type, Issue fields, labels, assignee, relationships, Project membership, and Status. For a pull request, verify base/head branches, draft and merge state, labels, assignees/reviewers, linked Issues, Project membership, and Status; Issue Type and Issue fields do not apply. Report any metadata that the available API or UI could not set.
- The human owner reviews, approves, and merges pull requests. Agents never merge pull requests or execute releases.
